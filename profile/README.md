## GreenSync
GreenSync is an organization that develops innovative solutions for agriculture. Our mission is to create sustainable and efficient farming practices through the use of technology.

## Our Projects
At GreenSync, we are constantly working on new projects to help farmers increase their yields, reduce costs, and improve the overall health of their farms. Some of our notable projects include:

## GreenSync Web Application
Our web application is a powerful tool for farmers to manage their farms more efficiently. It allows farmers to track their crops, monitor weather conditions, and receive alerts for potential issues. The application also integrates with IoT devices distributed by GreenSync, allowing farmers to easily record data and analyze trends.

## IoT Devices
GreenSync distributes a range of IoT devices to farmers to help them gather data about their farms. These devices include weather sensors, soil moisture sensors, and pest monitoring systems. By using these devices, farmers can make informed decisions about how to manage their crops, reducing waste and maximizing yields.
